	<h1>Food</h1> 
	<p>Traditional foods during Lunar New Years include fish, oranges, noodles, and many others. Fish is eaten normally on a daily basis. However, it still is symbolic
	for prosperity. Noodles are typically eaten because they symbolize longitivity. <a href="https://zolimacitymag.com/why-mandarin-oranges-popular-chinese-new-year/">Oranges</a> 
	are eaten because they represent good luck. However, some families don't eat them and prefer to use them as a house decoration. </p>
