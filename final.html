		<h3> Project Description </h3>
			<div class="center"> 
				The project is essentially just a page that provides visuals on a dataset. 
				The dataset is completely modifiable and will work as long as the provided 
				data is a set of numbers. 
			</div>
			
		<h3> How it Works </h3>
			<div class="center"> 
				A list of rates inspired by <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/">Bankrates</a> 
				and <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/rates/banking/all-accounts">Nerdstreet Wallet</a> are put into a CSV file.
				It is then read and stored in separate lists within a list. The program then takes two random rates and separates them into
				three parts: the initial balance, the rate, and the compounds per year. It then takes the compound interest formula and takes 
				the values to generate a new list, one with the values in the table. The values are then graphed and also plugged into 
				another program that will take these values and places them accordingly in the table. 
			</div>

		<h3> Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of </h3>
			<div class="center">
				This page is not formatted completely the way that it was required. The reason being that the navigation
				bar was originally part of the idea. Taking the bar away would mean that the CSS page and the layout of the 
				HTML pages would also have to be restructured. 
			</div> 
			<div class="center">
				The reason that there are only 20 points is that more would be slightly redundant and my computer
				was unable to print that many values without lagging the computer. 
			</div>
			<div class="center">
				The program that produced the lists was producing a blank list at one point such that 
				one of the list would be blank, and the graph would only show one line of data.
