	<h1>Traditions</h1>
		<p>During Lunar New Years, it is customary for people to dress in bright clothing, typically the color red. It is associated with good luck and fortune,
		hence why red is generally associated with Lunar New Years. Another important tradition is to spend time with family. During New Years Eve, families gather
		together for a final dinner. Even after the New Year festivities, people take a week off to visit family members they don't see very often. One common activity
		is giving or receiving red envelopes or 红包 (hong bao). Children receive envelopes with random amounts of money inside. Other activities include a fireworks show, 
		new years cleaning, and <a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/special-report/chinese-new-year/new-year-lion-dance.htm">lion dance parades</a></p>
